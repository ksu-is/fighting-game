# fighting-game
#### A game that allows a user to fight against the computer by choosing an attack or heal from a list.  The user and computer start with 100 health which is stored and the first to get their opponent to 0, wins. Health is either deducted or added depending on what the user inputs. The user must decide between a standard damage attack, a varied damage attack, a paralyzing attack with high failure rate that causes the opponent to miss their turn and take a small amount of damage, or a heal.
